/* INSERTION DEVICE CROSS-COUPLED DRIVE OF GANTRY SYSTEM
Motors #1 (X1) and #5 (X2) are the driving gantry, which has direct encoder feedback on registers $3503 (I8002) and $3506 (I8005). The reversed feedback signal of motor #5 is assigned to encoder channel 9.
NOTE: To invert the Servo IC m Channel n PFM Direction signal, I7mn8 needs to be changed from 0 to 1. When I7mn8 is set to 1, a positive direction command provides a high output. This needs to be applied for servo ic 2 channel 1, i.e. axis 9. Otherwise, the A and B signals need to be swapped on the motor cable.
